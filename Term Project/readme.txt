This project, called “Plants vs Kozbies” is a game where the evil Kozbies spawn on the right side of the screen and attempt to progress to the left of the screen, which is the house. The player can build plants to prevent the zombies from reaching their destination, based on a “sun” currency system. The game is won after a certain time of defense, and is lost of the zombies reach their destination. This project is written in Python and hence requires IDLE to run.
